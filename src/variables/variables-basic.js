    */
/*------------------        let ( block scope)        --------------
    -> ES6 introduced new way to decalre variable.
    -> With this way we can declare variable with block scop.
    -> Block scop means the scope of variable is limitted within  {} 
       where we declare that variable.
    -> Also unlike var, before using variable we need to declare that.
    -> let should be your second choice â€“ use it whenever you need to re-assign variables. 
       This will mostly be the case in mathematical alogrithms or loops.
