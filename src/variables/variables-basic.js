    -> ES6 introduced new way to decalre variable.
    -> With this way we can declare variable with block scop.
    -> Block scop means the scope of variable is limitted within  {} 
       where we declare that variable.
    -> Also unlike var, before using variable we need to declare that.
    -> let should be your second choice â€“ use it whenever you need to re-assign variables. 
       This will mostly be the case in mathematical alogrithms or loops.

    -> With this way we can declare variable with constent value that can not be reassign.
    -> const hold the pointer not a value. That's way we can't re assign this pointer.
    -> const is also a block scop variable

  /*------------------        Hoisting ( use before declartion)    ----------------
    -> Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved 
       to the top of their scope before code execution. Inevitably, this means that no matter 
       where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless 
       of whether their scope is global or local.
